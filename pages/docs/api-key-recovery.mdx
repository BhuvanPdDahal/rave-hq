# API Key Recovery

Unfortunately, RaveHQ doesn't store your API key in plain text for security reasons. If you've lost your API key, you won't be able to recover the original one. However, you can easily generate a new API key to continue using the RaveHQ API with your application.

Here's how to generate a new API key if you have lost it:

* **Log in to Your RaveHQ Account**: Head over to the RaveHQ site and log in using your credentials.
* **Navigate to App Details**: Once logged in, locate the "Apps" section within the RaveHQ sidebar and choose the specific app for which you have lost your API key.
* **Issue API key Loss**: You'll find a button labeled `Lost API Key` if you have already created an API key for that app. Clicking this button will open a modal and will try to confirm if you have really lost your API key. Click `Yes` to continue.
* **Enter Recovery Token**: After that, you'll be redirected to the API recovery page. Here, you need to enter the recovery token that is sent to your email and click `Confirm`.
* **Create New API key**: If the request gets successfull, you'll be redirected to the app details page where now instead of `Lost API Key` button, you'll find `Create API Key` button which you an use to create a new API key.
* **Update Your Application**: Replace the old API key stored in your application code with the newly generated one. This ensures your application continues to communicate with the RaveHQ API successfully.

We recommend treating your API key with the same level of care as your account password. By following these steps and best practices, you can easily generate a new API key and continue using RaveHQ's functionalities within your application.
